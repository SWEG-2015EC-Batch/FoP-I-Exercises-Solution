**Algorithms Design: Flowchart and Pseudo code**

In the field of computer science, algorithms play a crucial role in problem-solving and program development. One important aspect of algorithms design is the creation of flowcharts and pseudo code. Flowcharts are graphical representations that depict the steps and decision points of an algorithm, while pseudo code is a high-level, human-readable description of the algorithm's logic.

Flowcharts provide a visual representation of the algorithm, making it easier to understand and analyze the flow of control and data. They use different shapes and arrows to represent different types of actions and decisions. Flowcharts can be used to design, analyze, and communicate algorithms with others.

Pseudo code, on the other hand, uses a combination of natural language and programming language-like syntax to describe the algorithm's logic. It is not tied to any specific programming language and allows programmers to focus on the algorithm's design without getting bogged down in syntax details. Pseudo code can be easily translated into actual code in a programming language of choice.

Both flowcharts and pseudo code are valuable tools in the algorithms design process. They help in clarifying the algorithm's logic, identifying potential issues, and communicating the design to others. By using flowcharts and pseudo code, programmers can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their algorithm design process.

**Example:**

Consider the following example to understand the concepts of flowcharts and pseudo code. Let's say we want to write an algorithm to find the maximum number among three given numbers.

1. Start
2. Read three numbers: num1, num2, num3
3. Set maxNum as num1
4. If num2 is greater than maxNum, set maxNum as num2
5. If num3 is greater than maxNum, set maxNum as num3
6. Print maxNum
7. Stop

Using flowcharts and pseudo code, we can clearly define the steps and logic of the algorithm to find the maximum number among three given numbers. These representations help in understanding and communicating the algorithm's design effectively.

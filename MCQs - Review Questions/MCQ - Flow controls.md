(D) All of these
```
**4. Consider the following loop :**^
    **for(int i=0; i<5; i++) ;
What will be the value of i after this loop?**
(A) It will give compilation error.
(B) 5
(C) 6
(D) Some Garbage value
**5. A switch construct can be used with which of the following types of variable?**^

```

    (C) case followed by value
    (D) All of these
**7. What is the effect of writing a break statement inside a loop?**
    (A) It cancels remaining iterations. (B) It skips a particular iteration.
    (C) The program terminates immediately. (D) Loop counter is reset.
**8. What is the effect of writing a continue statement inside a loop?**^
    (A) It cancels remaining iterations.
    (B) It skips execution of statements which are written below it.
    (C) The program terminates immediately.
    (D) Loop counter is reset.

**9.** (^) **If the variable count exceeds 100, a single statement that prints
“Too many” is**


```
(A) if (count<100) cout << “Too many”;
(B) if (count>100) cout >> “Too many”;
(C) if (count>100) cout << “Too many”;
(D) None of these.
```
**10. The break statement causes an exit**
    (A) from the innermost loop only.
    (B) only from the innermost switch.
    (C) from all loops & switches.
    (D) from the innermost loop or switch.
**11. for (; ;)**
    (A) means the test which is done using some expression is always true
    (B) is not valid
    (C) will loop forever
    (D) should be written as for( )
**12. Consider the following statements:
int x = 22,y=15;
x = (x>y)? (x+y) : (x-y);
What will be the value of x after executing these statements?**
(A) 22
(B) 37
(C) 7
(D) Error. Cannot be executed

**13.** (^) If you wanted to start from 100 and loop to 3 in C++, what syntax

# should be used?

```
(A) for(int i = 0; i < 100; i+3) {}
(B) for(int i = 3; i > 100; i--) {}
(C) for(int i = 100; i < 3; i++) {}
(D) for(int i = 100; i > 3; i--) { }
```

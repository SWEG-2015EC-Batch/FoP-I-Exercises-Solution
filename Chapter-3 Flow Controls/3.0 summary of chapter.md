# An Overview of Flow controls

## What is Program Flow Controls?

Program flow controls refer to the statements or constructs in a programming language that allow for the control of the execution flow of a program. These controls include conditional statements (if-else, switch), loops (for, while, do-while), and branching statements (break, continue, return).

Program flow controls are essential in programming as they determine the order in which statements are executed. These controls allow developers to create flexible and dynamic programs by providing mechanisms to make decisions, repeat a set of instructions, and alter the flow of execution based on certain conditions.

Conditional statements, such as if-else and switch, enable the program to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions. For example, if a certain condition is met, the program can perform a certain action, and if the condition is not met, it can perform an alternative action.

Loops, including for, while, and do-while, allow repetitive execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met. This is useful for performing tasks that need to be repeated multiple times, such as iterating through a list of items or performing calculations.

Branching statements, such as break, continue, and return, provide additional control over the flow of execution. The break statement allows the program to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely, while the continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one. The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value.

By utilizing these flow control mechanisms, programmers can create programs that are more efficient, flexible, and responsive to different scenarios. Understanding and effectively using flow controls is crucial in developing robust and functional software.

## Selection Statements Syntax

Selection statements, also known as conditional statements, allow the program to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions. They are an essential part of programming languages and play a crucial role in controlling the flow of execution in a program.

### If-Else Statement:

The if-else statement is used to execute a code block if a certain condition is true and another code block if the condition is false. The syntax for the if-else statement in most programming languages is as follows:

```C++
if (condition) {
    # code block executed if condition is true
}
else {
    # code block executed if condition is false
}
```

The condition is an expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the condition is true, the code block associated with the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the code block associated with the else statement is executed.

### If-Else IF Statement:

The if-else if statement is used to execute a code block with multiple alternative condition. The syntax for the if-else statement in most programming languages is as follows:

```C++
if (condition-1) {
    # code block executed if condition-1 is true
}
else if (condition-2) {
   # code block executed if condition-2 is true
}
else if (condition-3) {
   # code block executed if condition-3 is true
}
.
.
.
else {
    # code block executed if condition is false
}
```

The conditions are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. If the condition is true, the code block associated with the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the code block associated with the else statement is executed.

### Switch Statement:

The switch statement is used to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression. It provides a more concise way to handle multiple conditions compared to using multiple if-else statements. The syntax for the switch statement in most programming languages is as follows:

```C++
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        # code block executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        # code block executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    default:
        # code block executed if expression does not match any case
 }
```

The expression is evaluated, and its value is compared with the values specified in each case. If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed. The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after executing the code block of a matched case. If no match is found, the code block associated with the default case is executed.

Understanding the syntax of selection statements is crucial for controlling the flow of execution in a program based on different conditions. It allows developers to write more flexible and dynamic programs by selectively executing code blocks based on specific criteria.

## Loop statements syntax

### For Loop:

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values or to execute a block of code a specific number of times. The syntax for the for loop in most programming languages is as follows:

The variable is a placeholder that takes on the value of each item in the sequence, one at a time. The code block associated with the for loop is executed for each item in the sequence.

### While Loop:

The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax for the while loop in most programming languages is as follows:

![image](https://github.com/SWEG-2015EC-Batch/FoP-I-Exercises-Solution/assets/73167960/dd577f22-da40-403f-b20e-6bad082e51c5)

The condition is an expression that evaluates to either true or false. As long as the condition is true, the code block associated with the while loop is executed.

### Do-While Loop:

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false. The syntax for the do-while loop in most programming languages is as follows:

![image](https://github.com/SWEG-2015EC-Batch/FoP-I-Exercises-Solution/assets/73167960/b0d01cae-9f6a-4602-81ae-3011d2412d73)

The code block is executed first, and then the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the code block is executed again.

Loop statements are powerful tools for performing repetitive tasks in a program. By using loops, developers can avoid writing redundant code and make their programs more efficient and concise.

## Jumping Statements 

In programming, jumping statements are used to alter the flow of control within a program. These statements allow you to transfer control from one part of the program to another. The three main jumping statements in C++ are:

  ### 1) break Statement:
  
  The break statement is used to terminate the execution of a loop (such as for, while, or do-while) or a switch statement prematurely. When encountered, the break statement causes the program to exit the loop or switch statement immediately.
  
  Example: 
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break; // Terminate the loop when i equals 5
        }
      cout << i << " ";
    }
    
 ### 2) continue Statement:
 
 The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the loop's code and move to the next iteration of the loop. It is commonly used inside loops to skip specific iterations based on a condition.
 
 Example:
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            continue; // Skip even numbers
        }
      cout << i << " ";
    }

### 3) return Statement:

The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the calling code. It can also be used to terminate a program if the return type of the main function is not void.

These jumping statements provide mechanisms for altering the normal sequential execution of code and are useful in scenarios where you need to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
